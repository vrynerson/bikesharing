## Overview of the analysis: 

Citi Bikes have been a successful transportation option in New York City for nearly the last decade. From the daily commute to out of town visitors, biking has shown itself to be a great way to get to where you need to be or explore the city. The analysis on data from August, 2018 in New York will help the client to convince investors that a bike-sharing program will be beneficial to the city of Des Moines, Iowa.
